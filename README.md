# tic_tac_toe_take_two
Doing some stuff over to refamiliarize myself with ruby. This time around I actually used classes as they should have been used, and I feel that things are much better organized for it.

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game that you play in the terminal. It keeps track of both player's names and keeps score after every game.
